    "## XGBoost Testing\n",
    "To establish a baseline understanding of XGBoost behavior on the stroke prediction dataset, an initial model was trained using default-style hyperparameters and the root mean squared error (RMSE) evaluation metric. Training and evaluation performance were monitored across boosting iterations using both the training and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this initial testing phase, the model exhibited clear signs of overfitting. As the number of boosting rounds increased, the training error steadily decreased while the evaluation error increased. This divergence indicates that the model was increasingly fitting noise in the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to overfitting concerns, RMSE was found to be an unsuitable evaluation metric for this task. Stroke prediction is a binary classification problem with a highly imbalanced class distribution, where the minority class represents stroke occurrences. RMSE does not explicitly account for class imbalance and does not differentiate between false positives and false negatives. As a result, a model optimized for RMSE may achieve low error by primarily predicting the majority class, while failing to correctly identify stroke cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because false negatives are particularly costly in medical screening contexts, evaluation metrics that emphasize sensitivity to the positive class are more appropriate. This observation motivated a transition away from RMSE toward a classification-focused metric that better reflects model performance on the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these findings, subsequent experiments replaced RMSE with the area under the precision–recall curve (PR-AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. PR-AUC provides a more informative assessment of performance for imbalanced classification tasks by directly capturing the trade-off between precision and recall, particularly for rare positive outcomes such as strokes."

    "### Defining Computational and Environmental Metrics for XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the computational efficiency and environmental impact of the boosted tree model (XGBoost), a set of model-appropriate metrics was defined and implemented directly within the training and tuning workflow. While many efficiency and sustainability metrics apply broadly across machine learning models, neural-network-specific measures require adaptation when applied to tree-based algorithms. To enable meaningful comparison with neural network approaches, floating point operations (FLOPs) were explicitly estimated for boosted decision trees using a traversal-based approximation that reflects the structure of tree ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "All metrics were collected programmatically during execution using a custom monitoring utility. As a result, the reported values reflect the full cost of model development, including cross-validated grid search, learning rate tuning with early stopping, and final model training, rather than only the cost of the final fitted model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The following metrics were used to quantify computational efficiency for the boosted tree model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training time\n",
    "- Average CPU utilization\n",
    "- Peak CPU utilization\n",
    "- RAM usage\n",
    "- Floating point operations (FLOPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Metric Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Training time (s)\n",
    "= End time − Start time\n",
    "\n",
    "Training time was measured as wall-clock time spanning the entire model development process, including hyperparameter search and final training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average CPU utilization (%)\n",
    "= (Sum of CPU utilization samples) / (Number of samples)\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU usage was sampled periodically during execution using system-level monitoring, capturing average utilization across the full training and tuning period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak CPU utilization (%)\n",
    "= Maximum value observed across all CPU samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak CPU utilization represents the highest instantaneous CPU usage observed during model training or evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAM usage (GB)\n",
    "= Resident Set Size (bytes) / 1,000,000,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory usage was measured using the process resident set size, capturing the total memory footprint of the Python process, including the dataset stored in XGBoost’s DMatrix format and the learned tree structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FLOPs Estimation for Boosted Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosted trees do not rely on dense matrix multiplications as neural networks do. Instead, their computational cost is dominated by decision node evaluations during tree traversal and gradient-based updates during training. FLOPs were therefore estimated using a traversal-based approximation aligned with the structure of boosted decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "FLOPs per training run\n",
    "= Number of samples × Number of boosting rounds × Average tree depth × k × C\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average tree depth serves as a proxy for the number of node evaluations per tree\n",
    "- k represents the number of floating point operations per node evaluation, accounting for comparison and branching\n",
    "- C is a training multiplier accounting for forward traversal, gradient computation, and tree update operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cumulative FLOPs Accounting\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately capture total computational cost, FLOPs were accumulated across all stages of model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search FLOPs were estimated by multiplying the FLOPs of a single model by the number of hyperparameter combinations and the number of cross-validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate and early stopping FLOPs were added based on the actual number of boosting rounds executed before early stopping for each configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final model FLOPs were computed separately using the same formulation, allowing the cost of the selected model to be reported independently while still retaining the cumulative FLOPs from tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the reported FLOPs represent the full computational expense of model selection rather than underestimating cost by considering only the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environmental Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The following metrics were used to estimate the environmental impact of training the boosted tree model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Energy consumption\n",
    "- CO2 emissions\n",
    "- Water consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environmental Metric Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy consumption (Wh)\n",
    "= (Average power usage × Training time) / 3600\n",
    "\n",
    "Training was performed on a personal computing device using CPU-based execution. A constant average power draw of 3.6 W was assumed based on system-level measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "CO2 emissions (g)\n",
    "= Energy consumption × Carbon intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon intensity was assumed to be 0.408 gCO2/Wh, corresponding to the regional electricity grid average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water consumption (mL)\n",
    "= Energy consumption × Water intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "A water intensity of 2.18 L/kWh (2.18 mL/Wh) was used based on U.S. national averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on Environmental Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Training was performed on a personal laptop rather than in a data center environment, so power usage effectiveness was not included. Region-specific carbon and water intensity data were unavailable, and national averages were applied. Cooling and infrastructure overhead factors were omitted for simplicity.\n",

    "### Cross-Validated Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This section performs structured hyperparameter tuning using cross-validated grid search to identify robust tree-level and regularization settings for the XGBoost model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before model tuning begins, computational tracking is initialized using the TreeMetrics utility. This enables measurement of training time, CPU utilization, and cumulative FLOPs across all tuning stages, ensuring that the full cost of model selection is accounted for rather than only the final model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class imbalance is explicitly handled prior to training by computing the ratio of negative to positive samples in the training set. This ratio is used to set the scale_pos_weight parameter, which increases the penalty for misclassifying stroke cases and encourages the model to allocate more capacity to the minority class without altering the underlying data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "An XGBoost classifier is then instantiated using conservative baseline settings. The exact tree construction method is selected due to the moderate dataset size, allowing precise split evaluation. Subsampling and column sampling are fixed below one to reduce variance and mitigate overfitting, while the evaluation metric is set to PR-AUC to align with the imbalanced classification objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using GridSearchCV with five-fold cross-validation. The parameter grid focuses on tree depth, minimum child weight, loss reduction threshold, and L1 and L2 regularization strengths. These parameters directly control model complexity and generalization behavior, making them appropriate candidates for structured search. Average precision is used as the scoring metric to remain consistent with the PR-AUC optimization goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "After fitting the grid search, the total computational cost of this stage is estimated by explicitly adding FLOPs associated with all cross-validated model fits. This calculation accounts for the number of parameter combinations, the number of cross-validation folds, the number of estimators per model, and the training set size. By incorporating grid search FLOPs into the overall accounting, the reported compute metrics accurately reflect the full cost of model selection rather than only the final chosen configuration.\n"
